1. Overview

Product Name: ChattyG
Purpose: A Slack-like collaborative messaging platform that will later incorporate advanced AI features (e.g., intelligent suggestions, summarizations, etc.).
Scope (MVP): Focus solely on the core chat functionalities essential to a team messaging platform, as listed:

Authentication
Real-time Messaging
Channel/DM Organization
File Sharing & Search
User Presence & Status
Thread Support
Emoji Reactions
2. Objectives & Goals

Immediate Goal (MVP):
Provide a stable and intuitive platform for team communication.
Establish the foundation (architecture, database, front-end structure) for future AI expansions.
Long-Term Goal:
Integrate AI-assisted messaging features such as message summarization, smart suggestions, and automated responses.
3. Functional Requirements

User Authentication
Must support user registration and secure login.
Roles/permissions (e.g., admin privileges) can be minimal at MVP stage.
Implement basic password resets (optionally via email link or code).
Real-time Messaging
Users must be able to send and receive messages instantly.
Maintain an active connection (e.g., WebSocket, Socket.io, or similar) for push updates.
Channel & Direct Message (DM) Organization
Users can create public or private channels.
Direct 1:1 messaging with other users.
Basic channel user management (invite or remove members).
File Sharing & Search
Allow users to upload attachments (images, documents, etc.).
A rudimentary file search functionality (keyword-based or metadata-based) within channels.
User Presence & Status
Indicate who is online, away, or offline.
Option for users to set a custom status message.
Thread Support
Users can start threaded conversations tied to a specific message.
Threaded responses stay contextually linked but are discoverable.
Emoji Reactions
Standard emoji reaction support for messages.
Optionally allow custom emojis if time permits.
4. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance
The app should handle real-time updates for multiple concurrent channels with minimal lag.
Low latency for sending and receiving messages is a priority.
Scalability
The MVP should employ a scalable architecture: decoupled services or a monolithic approach that can be modularized later.
Database schema should be flexible enough to accommodate new AI-related data fields in the future.
Security
Protect user data with encryption in transit (HTTPS/WSS).
Store passwords securely with hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
Maintainability
Code should be well-documented.
Project structure to easily add AI microservices or modules later.
5. Risks & Assumptions

Risk: Real-time messaging can become complex under high loads.
Mitigation: Use well-established libraries like Socket.io or Pusher.
Risk: File storage costs can increase with scale.
Mitigation: Consider cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) or limit file sizes initially.
Assumption: MVP user base will be small, so a single-server setup might suffice in the beginning.
Assumption: Future AI features will require a separate service or integration with cloud-based APIs.
6. Success Metrics (MVP)

User adoption & engagement: Number of messages sent, channels created, files shared, etc.
System reliability: Low error rates and minimal downtime.
Performance: Quick message delivery (real-time or near real-time).
User satisfaction: Basic usability tests and user feedback (e.g., Net Promoter Score for MVP).
7. Development Workflow

Below is a simple, logical order to build out the MVP. Each step can be tackled in small, iterative sprints, ensuring you always have a functional product at each stage.

Phase 1: Infrastructure & Setup
Project Architecture & Tech Stack
Decide on front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue) and back-end (e.g., Node.js, Python).
Set up a basic monorepo or separate repos for front-end and back-end.
Initialize a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Database Schema
Define schema for Users, Channels, Messages, Threads, Files (or attachments).
Ensure each entity can be extended later for AI-related data fields.
Basic Routing & Server Setup
Create endpoints for user-related actions (signup, login).
Set up a simple front-end router for navigation.
Phase 2: User Authentication
Signup & Login
Implement secure registration and login endpoints (JWT or session-based).
Password Management
(Optional MVP) Implement a basic flow for password reset.
Session Handling
Protect routes that require a logged-in user.
Use middleware for authorization checks if needed.
Phase 3: Real-time Messaging Core
WebSocket/Socket.io Integration
Establish a connection on user login.
Listen for incoming messages and broadcast them to relevant channels/DMs.
Message Sending & Receiving
Create an endpoint to post new messages.
Render the messages live in the chat window.
Basic UI for Channels & DMs
Show a channel list and a direct message list on the sidebar.
Click on a channel or DM to open the chat window.
Phase 4: Channel & DM Organization
Channel Creation & Management
Create new channels (public/private).
Add or remove channel members.
Direct Messaging
Implement 1:1 messaging flow.
Possibly expand to group DMs if time allows.
Channel Navigation UI
Show unread message indicators.
Maintain channel order or prioritization.
Phase 5: File Sharing & Search
File Upload
Integrate a simple file upload component (limit file types/sizes for MVP).
Store files locally or in a cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3).
File Download & Preview
Enable users to view/download shared files.
Search
Implement a simple keyword-based search across messages and file names (use database full-text search or an external service if needed).
Phase 6: User Presence & Status
Online/Away/Offline Indicators
Update user presence when they connect/disconnect from the WebSocket.
Custom Status
Allow users to set a custom status (e.g., “On Vacation”, “Busy”).
UI Indicators
Display presence/status icons next to usernames in channels and direct messages.
Phase 7: Thread Support
Thread Model
Extend Messages schema to link to a parent message (for threading).
Thread UI
Users can open a thread panel for any given message.
Threaded Conversations
Keep the main channel clean by housing related replies in a sub-view.
Phase 8: Emoji Reactions
Emoji Picker
Integrate a simple emoji picker library.
Reaction Storing
Extend your Messages or create a Reactions table to store which user reacted with which emoji.
Reaction Display
Show the top emojis under each message.
Aggregate multiple reactions of the same type.
8. Next Steps & Future Iterations

AI Features: After the MVP is stable, add AI-based functionalities like smart message suggestions, channel summarizations, or Q&A chatbots.
Customization & Integrations: Allow third-party integrations (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub) as advanced features.
Analytics & Reporting: Provide admins with usage reports and analytics dashboards.
Mobile App: Expand to mobile devices or optimize the web version for smaller screens.
