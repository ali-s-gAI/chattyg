   - Users can be members of multiple channels
   - Users can create messages and reactions

2. Channel-Related
   - Channels contain messages and members
   - Channels track their creator
   - Channels can be public or private

3. Message-Related
   - Messages belong to a channel and user
   - Messages can have parent messages (threading)
   - Messages can have multiple reactions
   - Messages track their thread count


## Notable Features

1. Real-time Support
   - All tables support Supabase real-time subscriptions
   - Timestamp tracking for real-time updates

2. Search Capability
   - Messages include ts (tsvector) for full-text search
   - Channels and users are searchable by name

3. Soft Features
   - Message threading support
   - Reaction tracking
   - User presence tracking via profiles.updated_at
   - Channel privacy controls

4. Data Integrity
   - Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
   - Timestamps for audit trails
   - Proper UUID usage for IDs

ALSO TO-DO:
- proper error handling for disallowed file types (show message: "Sorry, file type not allowed.")
- proper error handling for file upload errors (show message: "Sorry, file upload failed.")

RAG Features:

2. Database Structure:
   - `messages` table for regular messages
   - `channels` table including the ChattyG channel
   - `ai_conversations` and `ai_messages` tables for AI interactions
   - `embeddings` table with pgvector enabled for similarity search

3. Latest Addition:
   - Created Next.js API route at `app/api/chattyg/route.ts` for RAG implementation
   - Using OpenAI for embeddings and chat completion
   - Using pgvector in Supabase for similarity search

## Current Goal
Implement RAG functionality where:
1. Users can chat in the ChattyG channel
2. ChattyG responds using context from:
   - All channels (default)
   - Selected channels only (to be implemented)
3. Messages appear in the ChattyG channel like regular messages

## Technical Requirements
1. Need to implement vector similarity search
2. Need to integrate with existing channel message system
3. Need to handle embeddings for new messages
4. Need to display AI responses in the ChattyG channel

## Next Steps
Need help implementing:
1. The vector similarity search function in Supabase
2. Integration with existing channel components
3. Message embedding generation system
4. ChattyG channel interface

**RAG WoOK,rkflow with Supabase:**
1. **Storage & Embeddings:**
   - Messages stored in Supabase database
   - Embeddings stored in Supabase using pgvector
   - No need for Pinecone since pgvector handles vector similarity

2. **When a user sends a message to ChattyG:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
      User->>ChattyG: Asks question
      ChattyG->>OpenAI: Generate embedding for question
      ChattyG->>Supabase: Search similar contexts using pgvector
      Supabase->>ChattyG: Return relevant messages
      ChattyG->>OpenAI: Generate response with context
      ChattyG->>User: Return contextual answer
   ```

3. **Supabase Edge Functions:**
   - Serverless functions that run on Supabase's edge network
   - We'll use them to:
     1. Generate embeddings (OpenAI API call)
     2. Handle RAG logic
     3. Generate final responses

Let's start by:
1. Setting up pgvector (from previous SQL)
2. Creating a Supabase Edge Function
3. Testing with some sample data


PRD
1. Overview

Product Name: ChattyG
Purpose: A Slack-like collaborative messaging platform that will later incorporate advanced AI features (e.g., intelligent suggestions, summarizations, etc.).
Scope (MVP): Focus solely on the core chat functionalities essential to a team messaging platform, as listed:

Authentication ✅
Real-time Messaging ✅
Channel/DM Organization ✅
File Sharing ✅
Search ✅
User Presence & Status ✅
Thread Support [need to fix UI element e.g. introduce toggle to collapse/expand thread]
Emoji Reactions [need to edit UI to show that current user has used a reaction (press/depressed design)]
Deploy to Vercel [WIP]
Add RAG: "ChattyG" AI assistant [ ]
AI avatars for users (who enable option) [ ]

2. Objectives & Goals

Immediate Goal (MVP):
Provide a stable and intuitive platform for team communication.
Establish the foundation (architecture, database, front-end structure) for future AI expansions.
Long-Term Goal:
Integrate AI-assisted messaging features such as message summarization, smart suggestions, and automated responses.
3. Functional Requirements

User Authentication
Must support user registration and secure login.
Roles/permissions (e.g., admin privileges) can be minimal at MVP stage.
Implement basic password resets (optionally via email link or code).
Real-time Messaging
Users must be able to send and receive messages instantly.
Maintain an active connection (e.g., WebSocket, Socket.io, or similar) for push updates.
Channel & Direct Message (DM) Organization
Users can create public or private channels.
Direct 1:1 messaging with other users.
Basic channel user management (invite or remove members).
File Sharing & Search
Allow users to upload attachments (images, documents, etc.).
A rudimentary file search functionality (keyword-based or metadata-based) within channels.
User Presence & Status
Indicate who is online, away, or offline.
Option for users to set a custom status message.
Thread Support
Users can start threaded conversations tied to a specific message.
Threaded responses stay contextually linked but are discoverable.
Emoji Reactions
Standard emoji reaction support for messages.
Optionally allow custom emojis if time permits.
4. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance
The app should handle real-time updates for multiple concurrent channels with minimal lag.
Low latency for sending and receiving messages is a priority.
Scalability
The MVP should employ a scalable architecture: decoupled services or a monolithic approach that can be modularized later.
Database schema should be flexible enough to accommodate new AI-related data fields in the future.
Security
Protect user data with encryption in transit (HTTPS/WSS).
Store passwords securely with hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
Maintainability
Code should be well-documented.
Project structure to easily add AI microservices or modules later.
5. Risks & Assumptions

Risk: Real-time messaging can become complex under high loads.
Mitigation: Use well-established libraries like Socket.io or Pusher.
Risk: File storage costs can increase with scale.
Mitigation: Consider cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) or limit file sizes initially.
Assumption: MVP user base will be small, so a single-server setup might suffice in the beginning.
Assumption: Future AI features will require a separate service or integration with cloud-based APIs.
Risk: Supabase foreign key relationships can cause join issues, especially with auth.users table
Mitigation: 
- Always verify foreign key relationships before implementing joins
- Use proper join paths (auth.users -> profiles) in queries
- Document the correct join patterns for common operations
- Test queries in SQL editor before implementing in code
- Use this diagnostic query to verify foreign key relationships:
  ```sql
  SELECT tc.constraint_name, 
         kcu.column_name, 
         ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
         ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
  FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
  JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
  WHERE tc.table_name = '<table_name>' 
    AND tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
  ```

Common Error Patterns:
- 400 errors often indicate join path issues
- Empty error objects ({}) usually mean permission issues
- Always check RLS policies when joins fail
6. Success Metrics (MVP)

User adoption & engagement: Number of messages sent, channels created, files shared, etc.
System reliability: Low error rates and minimal downtime.
Performance: Quick message delivery (real-time or near real-time).
User satisfaction: Basic usability tests and user feedback (e.g., Net Promoter Score for MVP).
7. Development Workflow

Below is a simple, logical order to build out the MVP. Each step can be tackled in small, iterative sprints, ensuring you always have a functional product at each stage.

Phase 1: Infrastructure & Setup
Project Architecture & Tech Stack
Decide on front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue) and back-end (e.g., Node.js, Python).
Set up a basic monorepo or separate repos for front-end and back-end.
Initialize a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Database Schema
Define schema for Users, Channels, Messages, Threads, Files (or attachments).
Ensure each entity can be extended later for AI-related data fields.
Basic Routing & Server Setup
Create endpoints for user-related actions (signup, login).
Set up a simple front-end router for navigation.
Phase 2: User Authentication
Signup & Login
Implement secure registration and login endpoints (JWT or session-based).
Password Management
(Optional MVP) Implement a basic flow for password reset.
Session Handling
Protect routes that require a logged-in user.
Use middleware for authorization checks if needed.
Phase 3: Real-time Messaging Core
WebSocket/Socket.io Integration
Establish a connection on user login.
Listen for incoming messages and broadcast them to relevant channels/DMs.
Message Sending & Receiving
Create an endpoint to post new messages.
Render the messages live in the chat window.
Basic UI for Channels & DMs
Show a channel list and a direct message list on the sidebar.
Click on a channel or DM to open the chat window.
Phase 4: Channel & DM Organization
Channel Creation & Management
Create new channels (public/private).
Add or remove channel members.
Direct Messaging
Implement 1:1 messaging flow.
Possibly expand to group DMs if time allows.
Channel Navigation UI
Show unread message indicators.
Maintain channel order or prioritization.
Phase 5: File Sharing & Search
File Upload
Integrate a simple file upload component (limit file types/sizes for MVP).
Store files locally or in a cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3).
File Download & Preview
Enable users to view/download shared files.
Search
Implement a simple keyword-based search across messages and file names (use database full-text search or an external service if needed).
Phase 6: User Presence & Status
Online/Away/Offline Indicators
Update user presence when they connect/disconnect from the WebSocket.
Custom Status
Allow users to set a custom status (e.g., “On Vacation”, “Busy”).
UI Indicators
Display presence/status icons next to usernames in channels and direct messages.
Phase 7: Thread Support
Thread Model
Extend Messages schema to link to a parent message (for threading).
Thread UI
Users can open a thread panel for any given message.
Threaded Conversations
Keep the main channel clean by housing related replies in a sub-view.
Phase 8: Emoji Reactions
Emoji Picker
Integrate a simple emoji picker library.
Reaction Storing
Extend your Messages or create a Reactions table to store which user reacted with which emoji.
Reaction Display
Show the top emojis under each message.
Aggregate multiple reactions of the same type.
8. Next Steps & Future Iterations

AI Features: After the MVP is stable, add AI-based functionalities like smart message suggestions, channel summarizations, or Q&A chatbots.
Mobile App: Expand to mobile devices or optimize the web version for smaller screens.
