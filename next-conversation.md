# Recent Progress
- Fixed embedding generation and storage
- Removed channel membership checks from RAG to allow all users to access messages
- Lowered similarity threshold to 0.3 for better matches
- Added detailed debug logging in ChattyG API
- Fixed cookie handling in Supabase client
- Removed theme toggle to resolve hydration issues
- Set app to dark mode only for demo

# Current Issues
1. Build Issues:
   - Type error in `app/chat/[channelId]/page.tsx` with Next.js generated types
   - Need to clean `.next` and `node_modules/.cache` before deploying

2. RAG Functionality:
   - Embeddings are being generated and stored (confirmed by debug logs)
   - `match_messages` SQL function needs verification
   - Similarity search and contextual response only working for User1? Something to do with the channel membership check?

3. UI/UX:
   - Sign-in/sign-up forms alignment issues
   - Theme-related hydration warnings resolved by forcing dark mode

# Next Steps
1. Pre-deployment:
   - Clean build folders and regenerate
   - Verify RAG functionality with fresh embeddings
   - Test user authentication flow

2. Future Improvements:
   - Implement proper channel membership for public channels
   - Add user guidance and onboarding
   - Consider @ mention AI avatar auto-response feature

# Important Notes
- ChattyG UUID: a7756e85-e983-464e-843b-f74e3e34decd
- Using OpenAI GPT-4 Mini for responses
- Using text-embedding-3-small for embeddings
- Current match threshold: 0.3
