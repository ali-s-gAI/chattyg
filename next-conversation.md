# ChattyG Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps

1. Created ChattyG Bot User
   - Created in auth.users with UUID: a7756e85-e983-464e-843b-f74e3e34decd
   - Profile automatically created via handle_new_user trigger
   - Set up as a regular authenticated user that appears in user list
   - Removed previous channel-based approach (dropped create_chattyg_channel function)

2. Modified Database for RAG
   - Added dm_message_id to embeddings table
   - Set up constraint to ensure each embedding links to either a channel message OR DM
   - Created match_messages function for similarity search across both channels and DMs

## Current Architecture
- ChattyG operates purely through DMs (no channel memberships needed)
- Can collect context from:
  - Channel messages (where user is a member)
  - Direct messages (where user is sender/recipient)
- Uses pgvector for similarity search
- Embeddings table supports both channel messages and DMs

## Next Steps

1. UI Implementation
   - Implement DM interface for ChattyG
   - Add loading states ("ChattyG is typing...")
   - Handle error states gracefully

2. RAG Implementation
   - Generate embeddings for new messages
   - Implement context collection using match_messages function
   - Format context for OpenAI completion
   - Handle response generation and display

3. Testing
   - Test embedding generation
   - Verify similarity search accuracy
   - Test conversation flow
   - Validate context collection from both channels and DMs

## Important Notes
- ChattyG UUID (save for environment variables): a7756e85-e983-464e-843b-f74e3e34decd
- No need for channel memberships or special channel types
- All interactions happen through regular DM interface
- Context is collected from both channels (user is member of) and DMs (user participated in)
