# ChattyG RAG Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for ChattyG using Supabase's pgvector and OpenAI, without need for external vector databases.

## Completed Steps
1. **Database Setup**
   - Vector extension enabled in Supabase
   - New tables created:
     - `embeddings` (for message embeddings)
     - `ai_conversations` (for RAG chat sessions)
     - `ai_messages` (for conversation history)
   - Vector search index created
   - RLS policies implemented

2. **Initial Embedding System**
   - OpenAI package installed
   - Basic embedding generation utility created


## Next Steps

3. **RAG Query System Implementation**
   - Create the ChattyG AI assistant interface which is similar to existing DMs or Channels (messages)
   - Implement vector similarity search
   - Add channel context selection (User can select which channels to include in the RAG context (default is all channels they are member of))

4. **UI/UX Development**
   - Add ChattyG as special channel that is always at the top of the channel list
   - Create channel selection interface
   - Implement chat interface
   - Add loading states (no need for streaming responses, but "ChattyG is typing..."). Let's eventually add this for all channels (so and so "is typing..." or "are typing...").
   - Handle errors gracefully

5. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Test embedding generation
   - Verify similarity search accuracy
   - Optimize response times
   - Test conversation flow
   - Validate channel context selection

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Already implemented in database
create table embeddings (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
    message_id uuid references messages(id) on delete cascade,
    embedding vector(1536),
    created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table ai_conversations (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
    selected_channels uuid[] not null default array[]::uuid[],
    created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table ai_messages (
    id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
    conversation_id uuid references ai_conversations(id) on delete cascade,
    content text not null,
    role text not null check (role in ('user', 'assistant')),
    created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Key Files
- `utils/openai.ts` - OpenAI configuration and embedding generation
- `app/api/embeddings/route.ts` - Embedding generation endpoints
- (To be created) `app/api/chattyg/route.ts` - RAG chat endpoint
- (To be created) `components/chattyg-interface.tsx` - ChattyG UI

### Security Considerations
- RLS policies in place for all tables
- Rate limiting needed for API endpoints
- Channel access permissions enforced
- API key security maintained

### Performance Notes
- Using text-embedding-3-small model
- Batch processing for existing messages
- Streaming responses for better UX
- Efficient vector search implementation

## Current Focus
Ready to implement the RAG query system and begin building the ChattyG interface.
